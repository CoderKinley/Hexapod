# Hexapod Robot Build from Scratch
This repository contains code and resources for developing a hexapod robot, a six-legged walking machine inspired by insects. Here, you'll find information on various aspects of design, construction, and control of your own hexapod robot.

## Overview
### Hexapod robots offer several advantages over their wheeled counterparts:

* Versatility: Can navigate over rough terrain, climb obstacles, and adapt to uneven surfaces.
* Stability: Multi-legged locomotion provides inherent stability compared to bipedal or uniped robots.
* Biomimicry: Insights from biology can inspire efficient and adaptable movement patterns.
* This guide is designed to help you understand the key elements of building your own hexapod robot, from hardware selection to software development.

## Project Structure
* Hardware: Contains design files, 3D printing models, and component lists for the robot's mechanical structure.
* Electronics: Provides schematics and wiring diagrams for connecting servos, motors, and sensors.
* Software: Includes code for controlling the robot's movement using inverse kinematics, gait generation, and sensor feedback.
* Documentation: Offers tutorials, explanations, and troubleshooting tips for each development stage.

## Getting Started
* Hardware: Familiarize yourself with the hardware design and choose the suitable materials and tools for construction.
* Electronics: Understand the circuit layout and connect all components according to the schematics.
* Software: Set up your development environment and install necessary libraries. Get comfortable with the code structure and purpose of each module.
* Calibration: Calibrate your servos and sensors to ensure accurate readings and movement responses.
* Testing: Start with basic movement commands and gradually progress to more complex gait patterns.
